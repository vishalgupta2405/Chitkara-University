<h1>CHITKARA SCHOOL OF HEALTH SCIENCES</h1>
<p>Healthcare industry is the largest growing industry. There is a large gap between need of competent and supply of good quality healthcare professionals. This necessitates the initialisation of more and more educational institutions to meet local, national and global demand for health care providers. Considering this, Chitkara School of Health Sciences was established in 2011 North India exclusively dedicated to the education of health care professionals.
We envision training and developing health care professionals who can create a difference in the quality of life of all those who require healthcare. Our graduates have great scope for employment in corporate hospitals, rehabilitation centers, polyclinics, industries, training institutions in India and abroad, apart from the option of private practice.

We feel this as to be the appropriate time to get trained human resource in Healthcare Institutions to take-up the challenges in the modern global healthcare institutions. The practical inputs are provided through our strong industry collaborations with industry leaders in healthcare management such as Fortis Healthcare and Sankara Eyecare. Our course curriculum is a blend of theory, practice and clinical exposure whereas the theoretical knowledge is provided through internal and external faculties and practical experience is delivered with the help of our industry partners</p>
<p>CHITKARA SCHOOL OF HEALTH SCIENCES, CHITKARA UNIVERSITY IS PART OF OCULUS PROJECT FUNDED BY ERASMUS+ EUROPE


OCULUS is a consortium of educators from optometry schools in Europe (Norway, UK, Spain and the Netherlands) and beyond with a three-pillar strategy to reform optometric education in Israel and India and harmonise it with European standards. This will mean greater employability and job mobility for graduates, and better trained optometrists will lead to a reduction in blindness and vision impairment.In pillar 1, new educational resources will be developed to reform the curricula in Israel and India, meeting the high standards of the European Diploma in Optometry (DipE), harmonising optometric education and scope of practice. The DipE was designed almost 20 years ago and is missing elements of education that lead to lifelong learning.

Therefore, pillars 2 and 3 bring innovations to optometic education, enhancing the standard even further, beyond DipE. In pillar 2, educational resources for evidence based optometric practice (EBP) will be developed. EBP is a vital part of effective patient care but is still a novel concept in optometric education, and there is a recognised need for better EBP education in optometry, making this an important addition to the DipE. In pillar 3, a personal learning network (PLN) will be created for optometry students and practitioners, as an online portfolio of patient encounters and platform for peer review and discussion. OCULUS has the support of global optometry governing and education bodies. The Israel Council of Optometry and the Association of Colleges and Schools of Optometry in India are full partners. European Academy of Optometry and Optics and the Norwegian Association of Optometry are associate partners. These organizations will ensure that OCULUS outputs are disseminated globally for maximum exploitation and impact.</p>

<p>Established in the year 2007, in a very short period of time, built its reputation as institution of excellence. No wonder that it is well on its way to become one of the premier journalism schools in north India.
As newspapers, magazines, TV channels, radio stations and the Internet jostle with each other for space in the average persons life, the baits to lure him turn more dramatic, scandalous and instant. Consequently, in this rush of breaking-news and fat pay-packages, facts are side-swept, research is compromised, and the truth twisted.

In such a scenario, it is only a media person with an unshakable integrity, sharp wit, impeccable training and an erect spine who is the hope to fight through the fluff to surface with the truth, a fresh perspective and a new direction. And that is the raison detre for CSMC.

We strive to ensure that each student who walks out of our program becomes one such hope. And with each passing year this tribe may grow to become a forceful team that changes the way the media industry thinks, behaves and operates. All CSMC programs are built on strong theoretical foundations, which are supported by applied research into the dynamics of communication and the creative industries. This is backed by imparting professional expertise to our students for which the School has established close links with national and regional media companies. CSMC also boasts of an excellent employment and research record</p>
